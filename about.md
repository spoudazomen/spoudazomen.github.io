Spoudazomen (<span class="greek-text">Σπουδάζωμεν</span>) is an initiative dedicated to the learning of _classical languages_ (Ancient Greek and Latin) and _critical thinking_.

Concerning Ancient Greek and Latin, our emphasis is on learning via “natural” methods (i.e., via “living language” or “immersive” approaches incorporating “comprehensible input”). We aim to produce and distribute resources for the learning of those languages in accordance with — though not dogmatically bound to — those methods. (In the future, we also hope to provide tutoring and teaching with the same aim.) Our initiative has large parts of both languages in view — Attic _and_ Koine Greek, Classical _and_ Post-Classical Latin — though its focus is skewed somewhat toward the language and idioms of the New Testament and Church Fathers.

Concerning critical thinking, our focus is on logic and informal reasoning (how to construct and evaluate informal arguments, i.e., arguments as they are typically presented in “real-world prose”). Here our aim is to produce and distribute resources primarily aimed at young learners, based on our belief that these topics need to be covered at an earlier age than is currently typical. We also hope to provide tutoring and teaching on these topics in the future.

### Team

Jason Rogers is Spoudazomen's founder. He has a degree in Philosophy with a minor in Classical Studies from George Mason University, as well as a Master’s and PhD (also in Philosophy) from the University of Rochester. His publications include articles in philosophy and a small book in Ancient Greek, <span class="greek-text">Ἐπιτομὴ τῆς Καινῆς Διαθήκης (Ἔκδοσις Κεκοσμημένη)· Μέρος Πρῶτον</span>. He has taught philosophy at the university level and Ancient Greek informally online, where he also regularly converses in both Ancient Greek and Latin.

### The Name

<span class="greek-text">σπουδάζωμεν</span> (spoudazomen) is the third-person plural present subjunctive of the Ancient Greek verb <span class="greek-text">σπουδάζω</span> (spoudazo). This verb has a range of meanings including _to strive_, _to be earnest_, _to work hard_, _to focus seriously_, etc. Intended here as a _hortatory_ subjunctive, <span class="greek-text">σπουδάζωμεν</span> can therefore be translated as "Let us strive!" It is used in this sense in the following quote from St. Ignatius of Antioch: <span class="greek-text">«μιμηταὶ δὲ τοῦ Kυρίου σπουδάζωμεν εἶναι...»</span>
