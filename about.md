title: About Spoudazomen
subtitle: Who we are and what we aim to do
---

Spoudazomen (Σπουδάζωμεν) is an initiative dedicated to the learning of classical languages (Ancient Greek and Latin) and critical thinking.

Our emphasis concerning Ancient Greek and Latin is on learning via “natural” methods (e.g., “living language” or “immersive” approaches that rely heavily on comprehensible input). We aim to produce and distribute resources geared toward the learning of those languages with those methods. (In the future, we also hope to provide tutoring and teaching with the same aim.) Our initiative has the bulk of both languages in view — Attic and Koine Greek, Classical and Post-Classical Latin — though its focus is skewed somewhat toward the language and idioms of the New Testament and Church Fathers.

Concerning critical thinking, our focus is on logic and informal reasoning (how to construct and evaluate informal arguments, i.e., arguments as they are typically presented in “real-world prose”). Here our aim is to produce and distribute resources primarily aimed at young learners, based on our belief that these topics need to be covered at an earlier age than is currently typical.
