Sometimes, at least, naming things is hard. (It is, they say, one of the hardest things in computer science.) But when it came to naming our initiative, the choice was rather easy. As we note on our [about][/about] page, the name Σπουδάζωμεν is a conjugated form of the Ancient Greek word, σπουδάζω, which can mean _I strive_, _I am being earnest_, _I am working hard_, _I am focusing seriously_, etc. The form <span class="greek-text">σπουδάζωμεν</span> is the third-person plural present subjunctive, intended to have the (hortatory) meaning "Let us strive!" or "Let us be striving!" And that's what we're about -- striving to learn things that are important, focusing seriously on things that matter. What that means here specifically is that we're focused on learning two of the most important languages in history, Ancient Greek and Latin, and on learning to think critically. We're only just getting started, but if those are things that interest you then we hope you'll check back here from time to time, maybe drop us a line, or check out some of the resources we've created or currently have in progress.

Thanks, welcome... and σπουδάζωμεν!
